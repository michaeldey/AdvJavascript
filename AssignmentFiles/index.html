		<h3 class = "header">Why I am studying Computer Science</h3>
		<p>
			I have always been interested in computers and computer science.  In my day to day work, I often have to write
			code in order to create an effect, or to get the computer to do a lot of work that I either can't, or don't want to do.
			</br>
			Because of this, I have noticed that I have been most excited figuring out the code behind something over actually
			completing a piece of animation.  I have also started writing small codes for fun, or to help me solve problems about
			things that I think about.  When I realized that this is a true passion of mine, I decided to get some formal training.
			</br>
			And that's why I'm in <b>this</b> class as well as why I'm studying at SLCC.

                <h3 class = "header">Favorite Media</h3>
                <p>
                    It's very hard for me to pick favorite pop-culture media, but I'll give it a shot.<br><br>
                    <b>Favorite Books:</b><br> 
                    &emsp; Currently, my favorite fiction book is <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One" target ="null"><i>Ready Player One</i></a> by Earnest Cline.<br>
                    &emsp; My favorite non-fiction book is probably <a href ="http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-grand-design.html" target ="null"><i>The Grand Design</i></a> by Stephen Hawking.<br>
                    <b>Favorite Film:</b><br>
                    &emsp; Panned by Critics, and a box office dud, <a href ="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/" target ="null"><i>Tron: Legacy</i></a> was bar none my favorite flick of
                    2010, and still above and beyond, the best 3D movie I have ever experienced.
                </p>
